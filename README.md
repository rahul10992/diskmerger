To consolidate info from all the hard drives I have

## Context
1. I have 4 hard drives. With a decade's worth of backups. Lets consolidate this. 
2. To Start - checked that the drives open on Mac and Windows. 
3. What do I want? 
   1. Have 1 folder with all the backups consolidated without any duplicates. 
   2. each backup might have duplicates in itself across the backups it saves.
   3. There are zipped and 7z files with the same info - it would be good to clean these up as well
   4. Check for equality of each file. In case the name is the same. But the file is diff. eg: s01e02
   5. Have some other tools to allow for all images/music in a folder to be routed to a specific location, sorted by type. 
   6. learn python
4. Start with:
   1. Get file names. 
   2. Check for uniqueness between disks and if equal, check metadata, and if reqd, hash of file.
5. More ideas:
   1. Provide merging of files from diff locations with a particular file type - merge all the 2000000 downloaded images
      a. Provide a choice for which folders - you dont want the travel images merged with all the memes.
   2.
